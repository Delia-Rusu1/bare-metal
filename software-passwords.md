# Managing software passwords
{: #cp_bpmanacctresp}

You can manage the passwords for the software on each device.
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin-software-passwords}

Go to the device menu and make sure that you have the correct account permissions to complete the tasks.

* Go to your console's device menu.
* Make sure that you have any necessary account permissions and device access. Only the account owner, or a user with the `Manage users` Classic infrastructure permission, can adjust the permissions.

For more information about permissions, see [Managing device access](/docs/vsi?topic=virtual-servers-managing-device-access).

## Managing software passwords on devices
{: #managing-software-passwords}

Software that is created on a device is assigned a password that is automatically generated by {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} infrastructure systems. Software passwords for each device are stored on the **Passwords** tab on the Device Details screen in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

After you access the software for the first time, change your passwords.

Optionally, you can store software credentials on the **Passwords** tab for each device. However, when you store passwords in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, any person with access to the account and appropriate permissions can view those passwords.
