# Deleting a custom image template (Beta)
{: #delete-bm-custom-image}

At any time, you can delete a bare metal server custom image template.
{: shortdesc}

The {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_long}} custom image templates feature is classified as beta and is available for evaluation and testing purposes. Which means that it might be unstable and can change frequently. Beta features also might not provide the same level of performance or compatibility that generally available features provide and are not intended for use in a production environment.
{: beta}

When you delete an image template, it can't be retrieved and is permanently removed from all data centers.
{: note}
