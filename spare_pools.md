# Spare pools
{: #bm-about-spare-pools}

The Spare Pool screen in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} allows users to manage the spare pool of devices associated with the account. Each device in the spare pool can be used as a backup device if more devices are needed. Devices must be designated as hot spares on the Spare Pool screen before you use them in this process. The Spare Pool screen can be accessed only by users with specific permission.

## Before you begin
{: #bm-spare-pools-prereq}

Before you can use spare pools, contact IBM to have the Spare Pool and Spare Pool OS Reload attributes added to your account.
For an individual in your organization to gain permission to manage spare pools, contact the account's administrator.

## Next Steps
{: #spare-pool-next}

Refer to [Accessing spare pools](/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-bm-access-spare-pools).
