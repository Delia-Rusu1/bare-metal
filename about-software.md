# About software
{: #about-software}

{{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} has strategic relationships with vendors to provide month-to-month licenses on 32-bit and 64-bit compatible software. When you order a device, you select the type of operating system and software for your device. You can add more software to your device within the {{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}} and change to another operating system by reloading the OS on your existing device. The IBM automated system provisions software onto your server by following best practice guidelines of each vendor to make sure that you have maximum stability and availability.

See [{{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} software solutions](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog#software){: external} for a complete list of {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} supported software.

Not all software options are available for all server types and not all software options are the same for monthly and hourly billing.

IBM includes instructions or considerations for using products in the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} environment. For more information about specific software, see the vendor-specific software documentation.
