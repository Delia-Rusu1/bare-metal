{: support}

If you receive a Purple Screen of Diagnostics (PSOD) on an ESXi server, it might be caused by one of the following reasons.

* A memory fault or other memory errors can cause a PSOD.

To fix a memory fault, restart the server to clear the memory.

If the problem persists, contact [support](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-gettinghelp).

* VMWare kernel issues.

To fix a VMWare kernel issue, restart the server.

If the problem persists, contact [support](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-gettinghelp).

For more information about VMWare kernel issues, see [VMWare technote](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1004250).{: external}
