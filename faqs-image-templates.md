# FAQs for custom image templates
{: #faqs-image-templates}

## Why don’t I see some of my disks as choices on the 'Create image template' page?
{: faq-image-templates-1}
{: faq}

Disks that aren't contained within a volume (storage group) aren't eligible to capture and therefore you don't see them listed on the page. If you want a missing disk to show up as a choice, you must submit a [support ticket](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-using-avatar) that asks to associate the disk with a volume.

## Why did my capture fail?
{: faq-image-templates-2}
{: faq}

When a capture fails, an error occurred. If the error can be resolved, you might be contacted by our support personnel. Until the error is resolved, a completed image isn't in the portal. If you want to know why the capture failed, you can [contact support](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-using-avatar).

## Why don't I see my captured images?
{: faq-image-templates-3}
{: faq}

If you don’t see a captured image in your portal, the capture experienced an unrecoverable error. For more information, [contact support](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-using-avatar).
