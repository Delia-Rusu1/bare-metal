# Migrating data or services with an add-on software migration tool
{: #bm-migrate-custom-image-control-panel}

If your bare metal server has add-on software such [cPanel](#bm-migrate-custom-image-cpanel), [MS SQL Server](#bm-migrate-custom-image-ms-sql-server), [Plesk](#bm-migrate-custom-image-plesk), or [R1Soft](#bm-migrate-custom-image-r1soft), you need to follow the vendor migration guidelines instead of capturing and deploying a custom image. See the following sections for the add-on software documentation links.
