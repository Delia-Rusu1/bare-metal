## Powering off a server
{: #bm-power-off}

You can create a server in advance to prepare for usage. After you create the server, power it off to make sure that nothing gets changed and that no one can access it. When you're ready, you can power on the server and have it ready in minutes.

2. Click **Actions** and select **Power On / Off**.

You are billed for the server while it is powered off. If the server is powered off, it stays powered off and you need to be manually power it on.
