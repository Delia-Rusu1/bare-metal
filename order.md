{{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} has strategic relationships with vendors to provide month-to-month licenses on 32-bit and 64-bit compatible software.  
{: shortdesc}

When you order a device, you select the type of operating system and software for your device. You can add more software to your device within the {{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}} and change to another operating system by reloading the OS on your existing device. The IBM automated system provisions software onto your server by using best practice guidelines of each vendor to ensure maximum stability and availability.

For more information about supported software, see [{{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} software solutions](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog#software){: external}.

Not all software options are available for all server types and not all software options are the same for monthly and hourly billing.
{: note}

If you need software that is not supported, use your root access to the server to install and configure your own version of that software. To return to a supported version on your device, reload the OS.

IBM includes instructions or considerations for using products in the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} environment. For more information, see the documentation of the vendor who produces the software.
