# Contract term pricing for bare metal servers
{: #about-reserved-bare-metal-servers}

Contract term pricing with {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_long}} is a great option when you want significant cost savings. You can choose between either a 1-year or a 3-year contract. A contact term bare metal server is a great option if you know that you need hardware for the long term and makes sure that your resources are available throughout your term. When your term is over, your billing continues on a month-to-month basis at the nondiscounted rate.

## Converting to a contract term bare metal server
{: #convert-to-reserved-bm}

Are you ready to take your eligible, existing monthly server and turn it into a 1 or 3-year bare metal server? Use the following steps to make the change.

1. Log in to your IBM Cloud [**Dashboard**](https://cloud.ibm.com/){: external} and go to your [**Device list**](https://cloud.ibm.com/gen1/infrastructure/devices){: external}.
2. From your **Device List**, click the server that you want to upgrade.
3. Under **Server Details**, next to your Billing term, click **Modify**.
4. Select either a _1-year term_ or a _3-year term_ and click **Continue**.
5. Repeat steps 2 - 4 for any other servers that you want to convert to a contract term. 

An email notification is sent one month before the end of the term. If you don't renew your term, your server reverts to a monthly billing cycle and the cost stays the same - it doesn't increase.
