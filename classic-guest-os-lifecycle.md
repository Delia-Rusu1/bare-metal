# Lifecycle for guest operating systems 
{: #guest-os-lifecycle-classic}

In the lifecycle of an operating system, end of support (EOS) is the last date that {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} delivers standard support for a version or release of a product. The end of support date is aligned to the vendor and community support dates. It's also the effective date that the product ceases to exist (is deprecated) and can no longer be ordered or purchased.
